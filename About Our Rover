Important Notes on our ROVER_12
-------------------------------

Functionality
1.Range Extender - 11 X 11
2.SPECTRAL_SENSOR - to collect the science

        Spectral sensor VS science
        --------------------------
        TYPE OF SCIENCE         COLOR           COLLECT
        Crystal Science         Yellow          Gather
        others                  blue,Red....    Dont Gather
        
3.Wheels 
        Wheels can move over terrain the fastest of any drive system.
        Wheels can travel over Soil and Gravel.
        Wheels cannot travel into or through Rock terrain
        Wheels will immediately get stuck upon entering Sand terrain.

Implementation
--------------
1.Wall Follower Algorithm and Our Motion Logic to Crawl through the Map
(Two algorithm switches whenever neeeded to discover large area)
2.Implemeted Communication with Green Corp Server
